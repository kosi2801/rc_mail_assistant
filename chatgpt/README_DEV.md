- Confirm default LLM model choice for the app and whether to include pre-downloaded model files in repo or rely on operator to fetch
- Choose vector DB default (Chroma vs sqlite-based)
- Create initial repo with Spec Kit and Docker Compose
- Implement core sync flow (Gmail fetch → store → embed → retrieve similar → draft generator)
